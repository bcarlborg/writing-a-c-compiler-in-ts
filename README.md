# C to x86-64 Compiler Written in Typescript

This repo contains the source, tests, and build system for my implementation of a C -> x86-64 compiler. I am implementing this compiler following along with the book _Writing a C Compiler_ by Nora Sandler.

For information about building and running the project see the [developer readme](./docs/DEVELOPER.md).
